	Homework 5

	P. Griffin

	Notes:	This program has all the requirements of the homework with a bonus component worked in.
			At the beginning of the game a ghost is brought into the map/house,
			and chases the player around. There is no win condition against the computer
			but if the computer/ghost does end up in the same room as the player it is game over.
